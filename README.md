You've made it to the source code powering my personal website and blog! Good to have you here, hope you enjoy your stay!

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run the project in development mode:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

You can do a production build using the following command:

```shell
$ npm build
```

## Hosting

I'm hosting this blog on Netlify. It's free, it's super easy, it's awesome. I highly recommend Netlify for hosting static sites. You can also use some other service such as Firebase Hosting or GitHub Pages.
