I started it because I was building a DigitalOcean mobile app using Ionic for use in managing your DigitalOcean resources from your phone. In looking at the various libraries available for my use, I disliked them for a few reasons, including use of callback functions instead of Promises, only being able to use some in Node and not the browser, among other things. Due to those issues, I decided to build my own that was structured how I would like to use it, with some key goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to use in a Node or Browser environment with no difference in usage.</li>
<li>Use Promises instead of callbacks so clients can make use of <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</li>
<li>Be built in TypeScript so consumers of the library can benefit from excellent intellisense with the TypeScript definitions.</li>
<li>Provide solid documentation including examples for usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>To that end I started development on DigitalOcean JS. Instead of building it all out quickly I decided to build it out as I needed it for the app I was building. As is usual with my side projects, (see <a href="/posts/my-github-graveyard">my previous post</a>) it languished to the side for a while. After writing that blog post, I decided that I wouldn’t let this project die. I literally had one set of endpoints left to implement.</p>
<p>It is with great pleasure that I finally get to announce the official v1.0 release of DigitalOcean JS. Check it out at the repo below, and keep fighting to keep your side projects alive!</p>
