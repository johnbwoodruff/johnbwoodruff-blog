This year I got a new job at a place called [GoReact](https://get.goreact.com/careers/) that allows me to work remote if I wish. I currently am enjoying working remote 3 times a week, and going in to the office on the other 2 days. As such, I needed a comfortable, ergonomic, productive workspace for myself at home. I have the fortune of living in an apartment that has an extra bedroom we don't use, so I use that as my home office. It's taken me close to a year to acquire all the pieces I wanted in a dream office, but I finally have a space put together that helps me feel inspired and productive while working. So, without further ado, here it is:

Here's another view of it from straight on.

I'm very proud of this workspace. Sure, it could use some help in the cable management department, among other places, but I love it. A lot of this I owned before setting up this home office, and some of it I bought when getting my space set up.

Here is a list of the things you'll see that make up my workspace:

* [Autonomous SmartDesk Business Edition](https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-business) with Cable Tray (to help with cord management)

Well, that's it. That's my workspace. It's got two windows so I get plenty of natural light. (they were closed so the photos wouldn't be backlit like crazy) It has a door I can close and lock so I don't need to worry about my sweet 5 year old walking in while I'm in an important meeting. It works perfectly for me.

I'm quite satisfied with the current state of my office. I am, however, saving up for a custom build gaming PC. My MacBook Pro is work-issued, can't play most of my video games, and definitely can't do VR. (I have an Oculus Rift S) So it may be close to a year before I can get that, but that's next on my list of what to add once I've saved up a bit more.

Let me know what you think! I'd also love to see some other workstations from the rest of y'all!
