I have a variety of hobbies, but the most obvious one is playing around with fun technologies. This applies not only to software, which I obviously write for a living and for fun, but also to hardware. Ever since I took apart my parents' VHS player to see how it worked (RIP that VHS player ðŸª¦) I have loved tinkering with hardware, and have since then built multiple PCs, wired my home for ethernet, installed security cameras, and more. The hardware projects I've most recently spent my time doing has been assembling my homelab in my basement, and that's what this post is about.

## What is a Homelab?

Before we dive into my specific homelab, we should cover what a homelab is for those who have never heard the term. It's a very broad inclusive term that refers to some sort of setup in your house that you can use to tinker, mess around with software or hardware, and generally experiment in the safe confines of your own home and network. This homelab can be as tiny as a single [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/) or old laptop, to something as big as a [Home Data Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeDataCenter/). The foundational concept is the same, however, it's some place at home to be able to mess around with tools and technologies for the purposes of learning and fun. The great thing is that you don't have to have a lot of money to build a lot of infrastructure, you can easily use an old machine you have lying around.
